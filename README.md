This project presents an in-memory computing (IMC) approach that integrates NAND and NOR logic operations directly within 8T SRAM cells to reduce processor-memory data transfers. Designed as part of the ECE-611 Memory Design course, the system overcomes read disturb issues inherent in conventional 6T SRAM by using isolated read/write paths in 8T architecture. NAND and NOR operations are achieved via controlled bitline precharging and wordline pulse timing. The implementation includes schematic design, waveform analysis, layout (26.25 µm²), and pre-layout power simulations across PVT corners. Future extensions aim to support XOR operations and layout optimization for enhanced logic functionality.
